## Description

This is the second project in Udacity's Front-end Nanodegree program. The challenge was to build an interaction memory game using the provided HTML and CSS files (and a little bit of starter JavaScript code).

The gameplay is simple. The user is presented with sixteen cards. Clicking on the cards causes them to 'flip' over, revealing a symbol. The goal is to find two cards with matching symbols. If the two cards chosen are not matches, they fill flip back order and return to their original state. If they do match, then they will stay revealed.

Each time two cards are flipped, the moves counter increases by 1. Once all the matches are made the player is shown a modal which shows hold long it took to complete the game, how many moves and a star rating based on how many moves it took for the player to win.
